# WOCS'hACK 2025 â€“ Bug Bounty Experience

This repository contains my personal bug reports from **WOCS'hACK 2025**, a bug bounty competition and my **first experience in vulnerability research**.

## About the Event

**WOCS'hACK** is a cybersecurity competition focused on discovering and responsibly reporting vulnerabilities in web applications and systems. It offers a great introduction to real-world bug bounty practices in a safe, ethical environment.

## What You'll Find Here

- My bug reports, organized by vulnerability type or target
- Only findings I am allowed to share publicly, in compliance with event rules

## What I Took Away

- A hands-on understanding of how to think like an attacker
- Experience writing clear, structured vulnerability reports
- Motivation to continue exploring bug bounty and ethical hacking

## What's Next

I'm planning to:
- Improve my technical skills with real-world platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd
- Practice more CTF-style challenges
- Learn more about vulnerability disclosure and secure development
